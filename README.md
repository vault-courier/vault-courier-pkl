# VaultCourierPkl

This repository contains the OpenAPI modules and Pkl templates for configuring [Hashicorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault) and [OpenBao](https://openbao.org) â€” tools designed to securely store, audit, and manage access to sensitive data like API tokens, database credentials, and certificates. This package generates the OpenAPI specification used by [VaultCourier](https://github.com/vault-courier/vault-courier), a Swift client for interacting with HashiCorp Vault and OpenBao.
